Does this look right? I hope so. This platform is cool

Hey Pav, it does! and it is haha. So, you created a new branch, and here's a new file. I suggest renaming the file ^ to 
something like Pavly's Project 2 code, and I'll do the same for mine. Post your code here and we'll have access to each other's
code regularly, then when we're sure the code is finalized we can merge the branches.
